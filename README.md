Coding Bootcamp HW3 by Kyle Rosenmeyer

**Psychic Game** is a letter guessing game in which 
the user attempts to guess the random letter chosen by the computer. 

This game is useful to learn the principals of javascript *arrays, functions, statements, and 
loops*. It is also useful to begin learning about the power of objects.

This project is not available for additional contribution from the github community, however
Kyle Rosenmeyer may be contacted through his website for help or questions
regarding the project.
